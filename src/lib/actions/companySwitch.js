/**
 * Parent company "switch into a child company" — only ever possible once
 * a Platform Operator has already linked a child via the Create Company
 * wizard (parent_company_id). Nothing here is self-service: a company
 * with no children, or a child company itself (grandchildren are
 * disallowed), simply gets an empty list / a 403 on every call below.
 *
 * Gated on the PERMANENT is_super_admin account flag (isSuperAdminAccount),
 * not the currently-active role — same precedent as the existing
 * available-roles/switchActiveRole code, so switching your own active
 * role away and back never locks you out of this feature either.
